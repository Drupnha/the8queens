# the8queens
- ♟️ I have created a program that solves the problem of the 8 chess queens.

- 📚 You have to place 8 queens on the chessboard without touching each other.

- 🤯 I have created this program in java in a few days, although I had already solved it a year ago with ".bat", yes... I also leave it here in case you want to see it, but trust me, you don't want to see it...
